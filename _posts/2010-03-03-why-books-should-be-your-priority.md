Dostoevsky’s Devils

This is the hardest of Dostoevsky’s novels. It’s hard enough to finish it let alone fully engage with everything that goes on in it. It’s the ultimate prank by Dostoevsky; you’ll find yourself looking for actions and inciting moments, only to find there are none. The book creeps along seemingly moving towards something while you have no idea what is creating the momentum. It’s equal parts frustrating and eery. Looking for a traditional ‘plot’, or reading up on the plot prior to reading it, doesn’t really help make it a more straight forward read.

I should mention that is a common feature of Russian literature. They aren’t usually presenting a ‘novel’ or a traditional plot; they deal with ideas expressed in actions or inaction. They (hopefully) make you read the content and then let your subconscious chew on it for a while. 

Dostoevsky’s writings often appeared in publication, published piece by piece over a period of time. It’s hard to imagine what it would have been like to read a chapter each week, and then anticipate or await the next part. It’s even harder to imagine that there were people reading them and having meaningful discussions and/or revelations about the text. Particularly today when our minds are engaged by content on social media readily available, it makes me wonder who was reading this material. Who really read it? Who really cared? Were there other publications that were easier to digest that people read more and talked about more but that did not survive into the modern era?

But I am going off topic. To summarise: it’s the hardest of Dostoevsky’s works, it’s terrifyingly prescient, and it’s a clear warning against a world without spiritual centeredness. Now before I go into these topics in more depth, I’ll attempt to summarise the ‘plot’ (and to emphasise, knowing this in advance may make reading it harder).

The story opens in a fictional town in the early to mid 1800s in Russia. Serfdom (slavery) has been abolished, and Russia is in the throes of its experiments with modernisation and liberalisation (both economically and intellectually). Those of higher political and social stature are either liberals or are using liberalism as a means to an end (greater political and social stature). And it’s not explicitly stated this way. Dostoevsky creates characters who represent something, and then let those characters/ideas interact. You’re watching adjacent/conflicting/void ideas interact with and react against one another.

Then, much is made of the return of two young men to the town, the sons of two of the main characters. These two are also representing ideas: Stavrogin and Stepanovich. The former a smart, charismatic, yet spiritually void, and the latter smart, manipulative, and seeking power for power’s sake. Their arrival in the town is this seemingly benign flashpoint that never really flashes. 

The characters/ideas intermingle, and when they do arrive at a ‘flashpoint’, it’s not a cathartic moment; it’s tragic. And even worse, it’s not totally clear how it got where it is. It leads to no meaningful change; it signifies nothing. To quote Macbeth, it’s all ‘sound and fury’.

So to start with ‘what makes this book hard to read’, 

It’s terrifyingly prescient, …

It’s a warning, …
