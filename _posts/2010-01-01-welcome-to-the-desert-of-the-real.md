I read a lot of books and often find myself with plenty to talk about but no-one to talk to about some of the books, at least for the length of time I'd like. So this blog is here for me to reflect on the things I read to make them 'stickier' for myself: to force myself to reflect a little deeper. It's also an opportunity to better familiarise myself with web technologies like Github and other dependencies that my blog uses, including Ruby and Gem.

I suppose I'm finishing the liberal arts education I began in my 20s. I received a degree in 2004 from the University of British Columbia, a double major in Modern European Studies and German Studies, and any extra space I had in my timetable were given to Canadian Literature. I definitely continue to read a lot of fiction and non-fiction in those three areas, but have also used the last few years to make myself more literate in STEM and politics. 

## Film

I don't write too much on films, unless I feel I have something of particular value to say about it, or it's a film that has a minimal digital footprint (ie there isn't much available online about it - it's been overlooked by content creators).
