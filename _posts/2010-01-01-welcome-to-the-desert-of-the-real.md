I read a lot of books and often find myself with plenty to talk about but no-one to talk to about some of the books, at least for the length of time I'd like. So this blog is here for me to reflect on the things I read to make them 'stickier' for myself: to force myself to reflect a little deeper. It's also an opportunity to better familiarise myself with web technologies like Github and other dependencies that my blog uses, including Ruby and Gem.

> This blog acts as both an opportunity to reflect on books I've read as well as a place to develop my familiarity with other web technologies.

I suppose I'm finishing the liberal arts education I began in my 20s. I received a degree in 2004 from the University of British Columbia, a double major in Modern European Studies and German Studies, and any extra space I had in my timetable were given to Canadian Literature. I definitely continue to read a lot of fiction and non-fiction in those three areas, but have also used the last few years to make myself more literate in STEM and politics. 

The blog posts may be updated from time to time without note. I typically don't finish a book or movie with a complete idea about what I have to say, usually just the themes and feelings I'd like to explore. Part of my process is the slow reflection on the book and its themes. I don't like to be too cavalier with my opinions, so extra reflection may lead me to update the articles from time to time.

AI is only used sparingly to learn more about the author or avoid any major oversight about the work itself.


## Film

I don't write too much on films, unless I feel I have something of particular value to say about it, or it's a film that has a minimal digital footprint (ie there isn't much available online about it - it's been overlooked by content creators).
